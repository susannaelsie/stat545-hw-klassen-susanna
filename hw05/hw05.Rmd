## 0. Pre-amble

I'm going to use both the gapminder dataset and a dataset from the Canadian Census of Agriculture to go through the exercises for hw05.

First I'll load all of the packages I'm going to need for this assignment in one tidy chunk of code (including <a href="https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson">a new colour palette</a> that I downloaded...)

```{r}
library("wesanderson")
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
options(knitr.table.format = 'markdown')
library(forcats)
library(readxl) #package already downloaded (bundled in the tidyverse package!) for reading excel files
library(RColorBrewer)
```


## 1. Factor Management

Starting with the gapminder dataset, I'll refresh my memory of what I'm working with here...

```{r}
gapminder
```


As I know this assignment works with factors, I've noted which variables are factors.

I want to drop observations for Oceania, and then drop the unused factor levels (left by Oceania's absense). First let me take a look at the number of factor levels (and associated number of observations for each) there are for the variable ```Continent```:

### 1.1 Gapminder: Dropping Oceania

```{r}
nlevels(gapminder$continent) # total # levels for continent (factor)
fct_count(gapminder$continent) # number of obs per factor using forcats package
```


```{r}
gap_5 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(!continent == "Oceania")
```

Now I'll use the forcats package to drop unused levels

```{r}
gap_5_dropped <- gap_5 %>% 
  droplevels()
nlevels(gap_5_dropped$continent)
```
 
 Checking to see if this worked...

```{r}
nlevels(gap_5_dropped$continent) # total # levels for continent (factor)
fct_count(gap_5_dropped$continent) # number of obs per factor using forcats package
```

Success!

### 1.2 Ag Census: Using factors in BC Agriculture data

Initially I was only going to bring in and take a look at these first two datasets on expensese and receipts(sales) on farms in the year 2006 (stored as an excel file in my working directory). However, once I got further along in the assignment I decided to bring in additional data for other years so that I have more to work with. Unfortnately, this data is not available in one excel file, but must be downloaded as individual files for each year (and sometimes for each variable). The readme.md file for this assignment has more description of each of these datasets. 

```{r}
exp_rec_86 <- read_excel("1986_exp_rec.xls")
exp_rec_91 <- read_excel("1991_exp_rec.xls")
exp96 <- read_excel("1996_exp.xls")
rec96 <- read_excel("1996_rec.xls")
exp_rec_2001 <- read_excel("2001_exp_rec.xls")
exp06 <- read_excel("2006_exp.xls")
rec06 <- read_excel("2006_rec.xls")
exp_rec_2011 <- read_excel("2011_exp_rec.xls")
```

These are somewhat large files (~2100 observations each and between 16 and 106 variables. So I'd like to zoom in on the measures and regions I am most interested in (see <a href="">my README.md file</a> for more details.

#### 1.2.1 Prepping the data

I'll use a combination of select and filter to create new dataframes with the information I care to look at (variables in the readme file and the Census Agricultural Regions (CARs) in BC), and then I'll do some work with factors. 

```{r}
exp_rec_86_BC <- exp_rec_86 %>% # note different column names for many of the datasets (though same variables)
  select(AREAID, PROV, CAR, CD, AREANAME, TOTEXP, SALES95, NTOTEXP) %>% #leaving enough information for future analyses
  filter(AREAID %in% c("590100000", "590200000", "590300000", "590400000", "590500000", "590600000", "590700000", "590800000")) # note that region names and numbers changed in 2001, so using AREAIDs here

exp_rec_91_BC <- exp_rec_91 %>% # 
  select(AREAID, CAR, CD, AREANAME, TOTEXP, SALES95, NTOTEXP) %>% 
  filter(AREAID %in% c("590100000", "590200000", "590300000", "590400000", "590500000", "590600000", "590700000", "590800000")) 

rec96_BC <- rec96 %>% 
  select(AREAID, CAR, CD, AREANAME, SALES95) %>% 
  filter(AREAID %in% c("590100000", "590200000", "590300000", "590400000", "590500000", "590600000", "590700000", "590800000")) 

exp96_BC <- exp96 %>% 
  select(AREAID, CAR, CD, AREANAME, TOTEXP, NTOTEXP) %>% 
  filter(AREAID %in% c("590100000", "590200000", "590300000", "590400000", "590500000", "590600000", "590700000", "590800000")) 

exp_rec_2001_BC <- exp_rec_2001 %>% 
  select(CAR2, CD, `GEO NAMES`, totexp, ntotexp, salesxfp) %>% 
  filter(CD == 0, `GEO NAMES` %in% c("Vancouver Island-Coast", "Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "North Coast", "Nechako", "Peace River"))

rec06_BC <- rec06 %>% 
  select(AGOPCAR, CENSUSD, AREANAME, VAL_SALESXFP) %>% 
  filter(CENSUSD == 0, AREANAME %in% c("Vancouver Island-Coast", "Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "North Coast", "Nechako", "Peace River"))

exp06_BC <- exp06 %>%  
  select(AGOPCAR, CENSUSD, AREANAME, NTOTEXP, TOTEXP) %>% 
  filter(CENSUSD == 0, AREANAME %in% c("Vancouver Island-Coast", "Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "North Coast", "Nechako", "Peace River"))

exp_rec_2011_BC <- exp_rec_2011 %>% 
  select(HDPROV, AGOPCAR, CENSUSD, AREANAME, VAL_SALESXFP, NTOTEXP, TOTEXP) %>% 
  filter(HDPROV == 59, AGOPCAR %in% c("01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", "08"), CENSUSD == "00") # once again need to use different filter because areas are named differently
```

Great! Much more manageable. Now I'll remove the larger dataframes, which I won't be needing anymore. 

```{r}
rm(exp_rec_2001, exp_rec_2011, exp_rec_86, exp_rec_91, exp06, rec06, exp96, rec96)
```


Now I will take look at the new [smaller] dataframes to see how the region names or region identifier are stored /what types of objects they are. I'll just check a subset of the dataframes to see what I am working with. 

```{r}
str(exp_rec_86_BC)
str(exp_rec_91_BC)
str(exp06_BC)
```

Oh boy - all sorts of fun going on there. 

- For the **1986** data, AREAID is a character, AREANAME is a character, TOTEXP is also a character (will have to change), whereas the other 2 measures/variables are numeric.
- For the **1991** data, same thing.
- For the **2006** data, AREANAME is a character, AGOPCAR is numeric, and TOTEXP is also a character (will have to change). 

So I know that I will have some conversions to do. I'll get those out of the way now.

#### 1.2.2 Changing ```things```

I'm going to start with a pilot test for converting one variable to a factor, and editing the names of the levels. 

```{r}
rec06_BC$AGOPCAR <- as_factor(as.character(rec06_BC$AGOPCAR)) 
levels(rec06_BC$AGOPCAR)<-c("Vancouver Island-Coast", "Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "North Coast", "Nechako", "Peace River")
```


Success (and I can see that the names are accurate because I still have the AREANAME column). Doing the same with the other 2006 dataframe for expenses:

```{r}
exp06_BC$AGOPCAR <- as_factor(as.character(exp06_BC$AGOPCAR))
levels(exp06_BC$AGOPCAR)<-c("Vancouver Island-Coast", "Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "North Coast", "Nechako", "Peace River")
```


And now I'll join these two dataframes, add a variable for year, rename variables, transform those that need to be numeric, and select only those that I want..

```{r}
exp_rec_06_BC <- left_join(exp06_BC, rec06_BC)
exp_rec_06_BC$TOTEXP <- as.numeric(exp_rec_06_BC$TOTEXP)
exp_rec_06_BC$VAL_SALESXFP <- as.numeric(exp_rec_06_BC$VAL_SALESXFP)
str(exp_rec_06_BC)
```

```{r}
exp_rec_06 <- exp_rec_06_BC %>% 
  mutate(year = 2006) %>% # adding a variable for year
  rename(CAR = AGOPCAR, nfarms = NTOTEXP, totexp = TOTEXP, sales = VAL_SALESXFP) %>% 
  select(CAR, year, nfarms, totexp, sales)
```

##### 1.2.2.1 Nonsense 

Now I'd like to do the same with the **other dataframes** (years 86 - 2001, and 2011), and ensure they have a common factor name and level  for Census Agricultural Region (as well as a unique identifier) so that I can join them later. I will go through the following process for each dataframe before merging them:
1. Create/change variable to include unique number for each CAR region (and ensure these are consistent with numbering used post 2001, not prior to)
2. Convert variable types as needed 
3. Drop unused variables
4. Add a column for year

1986 data:

```{r}
exp_rec_86_BC$CAR <- as_factor(as.character(exp_rec_86_BC$CAR)) #Re-naming to simplify names
  levels(exp_rec_86_BC$CAR)<-c("Kootenay", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Mainland", "Island", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") 
  
ord_86 <-exp_rec_86_BC$CAR %>% #Re-ordering (even though regions boundaries are different) to follow similar order to 2001 onwards
  fct_relevel("Island", "Mainland", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") %>% 
  levels()

exp_rec_86_BC$TOTEXP <- as.numeric(exp_rec_86_BC$TOTEXP) # change to numeric
str(exp_rec_86_BC) # check

exp_rec_86_BC %>% 
  mutate(YEAR = 1986) %>% # adding new column for year
  select(AREAID, CAR, YEAR, NTOTEXP, TOTEXP, SALES95) %>% # dropping unused variables
  knitr::kable()

levels(exp_rec_86_BC$CAR)
```

I realized at this point that the boundaries, names and numbers for some of the CAR regions are different here, and investigated to confirm that indeed CAR 1 was a different region in 1986 than from 2001 onwards. Moreoever, it wasn't just a name time, but the Census Divisions that make up the larger CARs are also different (e.g. in 2001 Okanagan and Thompson CARs were agglomerated to make the Thompson-Okanagan CAR.)

I decided to continue with this, though...


1991 data:

```{r}
exp_rec_91_BC$CAR <- as_factor(as.character(exp_rec_91_BC$CAR)) #Re-naming to simplify names
  levels(exp_rec_91_BC$CAR)<-c("Kootenay", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Mainland", "Island", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") 
  
exp_rec_91_BC$CAR %>% #Re-ordering (even though regions boundaries are different) to follow similar order to 2001 onwards
  fct_relevel("Island", "Mainland", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") %>% 
  levels()

exp_rec_91_BC$SALES95 <- as.numeric(exp_rec_91_BC$SALES95) # change to numeric
str(exp_rec_91_BC) #check

exp_rec_91_BC %>% 
  mutate(YEAR = 1991) %>% # adding new column for year
  select(AREAID, CAR, YEAR, NTOTEXP, TOTEXP, SALES95) %>% # dropping unused variables
  knitr::kable()
```

1996 Expenses data:

```{r}
exp96_BC$CAR <- as_factor(as.character(exp96_BC$CAR)) #Re-naming to simplify names
  levels(exp96_BC$CAR)<-c("Kootenay", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Mainland", "Island", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") 
  
exp96_BC$CAR %>% #Re-ordering (even though regions boundaries are different) to follow similar order to 2001 onwards
  fct_relevel("Island", "Mainland", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") %>% 
  levels()

exp96_BC$TOTEXP <- as.numeric(exp96_BC$TOTEXP) # change to numeric
str(exp96_BC) #check

exp96_BC %>% 
  mutate(YEAR = 1996) %>% # adding new column for year
  select(AREAID, CAR, YEAR, NTOTEXP, TOTEXP) %>% # dropping unused variables
  knitr::kable()
```

I noticed here that things started getting out of order...


1996 Receipts Data:


```{r}
rec96_BC$CAR <- as_factor(as.character(rec96_BC$CAR)) #Re-naming to simplify names
  levels(rec96_BC$CAR)<-c("Kootenay", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Mainland", "Island", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") 
  
rec96_BC$CAR %>% #Re-ordering (even though regions boundaries are different) to follow similar order to 2001 onwards
  fct_relevel("Island", "Mainland", "Okanagan", "Thompson", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "Omineca", "Peace") %>% 
  levels()

rec96_BC$SALES95 <- as.numeric(rec96_BC$SALES95) # change to numeric
str(rec96_BC) #check

rec96_BC %>% 
  mutate(YEAR = 1996) %>% # adding new column for year
  select(AREAID, CAR, YEAR, SALES95) # dropping unused variables
```

This is where things started to fall apart. I guess I don't understand factors *that* well. 

#### 1.2.3 Back to data I can work with

I know that for 2001 and 2011 the regions are the same, so I don't need to do any-rearranging, and it is acceptable to compare changes at the regional level. So I'll continue wrangling in these other 2 dataframes so that I can join all 3 of them. 

```{r}
exp_rec_2001_BC$CAR2 <- as_factor(as.character(exp_rec_2001_BC$CAR2))
levels(exp_rec_2001_BC$CAR2)<-c("Vancouver Island-Coast", "Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "North Coast", "Nechako", "Peace River")

exp_rec_2001_BC$totexp <- as.numeric(exp_rec_2001_BC$totexp) # transforming from character to numeric 
str(exp_rec_2001_BC$totexp)
exp_rec_2001_BC$salesxfp <- as.numeric(exp_rec_2001_BC$salesxfp)
str(exp_rec_2001_BC$salesxfp)

exp_rec_01 <- exp_rec_2001_BC %>% # assigning new name to save the table
  mutate(year = 2001) %>% 
  rename(CAR = CAR2, nfarms = ntotexp, sales = salesxfp) %>% 
  select(CAR, year, nfarms, totexp, sales)
```

```{r}
exp_rec_2011_BC$AGOPCAR <- as_factor(as.character(exp_rec_2011_BC$AGOPCAR))
levels(exp_rec_2011_BC$AGOPCAR)<-c("Vancouver Island-Coast", "Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Kootenay", "Cariboo", "North Coast", "Nechako", "Peace River")

exp_rec_2011_BC$TOTEXP <- as.numeric(exp_rec_2011_BC$TOTEXP) # transforming from character to numeric 
str(exp_rec_2011_BC$TOTEXP)
exp_rec_2011_BC$VAL_SALESXFP <- as.numeric(exp_rec_2011_BC$VAL_SALESXFP)
str(exp_rec_2011_BC$VAL_SALESXFP)

exp_rec_11 <- exp_rec_2011_BC %>% # assining a new nameto object to save
  mutate(year = 2011) %>% 
  rename(CAR = AGOPCAR, nfarms = NTOTEXP, totexp = TOTEXP, sales = VAL_SALESXFP) %>% 
  select(CAR, year, nfarms, totexp, sales) 
```


Now I'll join these three...

```{r}
ij1_exp_rec <- full_join(exp_rec_01, exp_rec_06)
exp_rec_01_11 <- full_join(ij1_exp_rec, exp_rec_11)
```


Now this is data has been 'wrangled' [FINALLY!] and is ready for some plotting.


### 1.3 Re-ordering the factors in a principled way

Before plotting this new dataframe ```exp_rec_01_11``` I will do some more work with factors with the first ag census dataframe that I joined for 2006. 

```{r}
exp_rec_06$CAR %>% 
  levels()
```

I'd like to calculate the percentage of sales that are profit for each region as a summary statistic, then re-order the data based on this. However, I have realized that my variables of TOTEXP and VAL_SALESXFP are currently in the character format! Not going to work for these calculations. So first I'll convert these to numerical.

```{r}
exp_rec_06$totexp <- as.numeric(exp_rec_06$totexp) # Converting to numeric
str(exp_rec_06$totexp) # Checking to be sure it worked
exp_rec_06$sales <- as.numeric(exp_rec_06$sales)
str(exp_rec_06$sales)
```

```{r}
fct_reorder(exp_rec_06$CAR, exp_rec_06$sales, .desc = TRUE) %>% 
  levels()
```

Now I will plot the total gross farm receipts (sales) by the ordered CARs. Only, the colour palette I have been dying to use only has 5 colours (wohn-wohn), so I am going to only plot 5 of the regions.

```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=7}
exp_rec_06 %>% 
  filter(CAR %in% c("Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Vancouver Island-Coast", "Peace River", "Cariboo")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(CAR, sales, .desc = TRUE), y = totexp)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = CAR)) +
  labs(x="Census Agricultural Region", y="Total Farm Operating Expenses", title="Total Operating Expenses on Farms by Census Agricultural Region in B.C.") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("Cavalcanti")) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(size=16, hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "right",
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.title = element_text(size=12))
```

Success!

Now, to make sure I accomplish the tasks from the homework, I'll create a new variable (instead of a summary statistic) that takes into account both measures of sales and expenses ((expenses / sales) * 100).

```{r}
exp_rec_06 %>% 
  mutate(perc_exp =(totexp/sales)*100) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Now I'll re-order based on this new variable, and plot that...

```{r fig.width=10}
exp_rec_06 %>% 
  filter(CAR %in% c("Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Vancouver Island-Coast", "Peace River", "Cariboo", "Kootenay", "Nechako")) %>% 
  mutate(perc_exp = (totexp/sales)*100) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(CAR, perc_exp, .desc = TRUE), y = perc_exp)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = CAR)) +
  labs(x="Census Agricultural Region", y="Operating Expenses as Percent of Farm Receipts", title="Expenses as a Percent of Farm Sales in B.C.") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = wes_palette("BottleRocket")) + 
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(size=16, hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "right",
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.title = element_text(size=12))
```

I wasn't able to also order the legend.



## 2. Writing to file, reading back

I'm going to try writing the re-ordered dataframe to a csv file.


First I tried using the ```fct_reorder``` function and then piping that into the ```write_csv``` command, but that prompts an error message, I think because the ```fct_reorder``` doesn't re-order the whole dataframe. 


So instead, I found this other way to re-order by the dataframe using indexing:

```{r}
exp_rec_06[order(exp_rec_06$sales, decreasing = TRUE),] %>% # Keep columns the way they are but order the rows by Sales
  write_csv("exp_rec_06.csv")
```

Now I'll bring it back in...

```{r}
read_csv("exp_rec_06.csv")
```

While the csv file is still in the specified order, the AGOPCAR variable is now a character, once again. So some information has been lost.

## 3. Visualization Design


### 3.1 Plot 1


I'd like to see the change over time in gross farm receipts and expenses, and I am particularly interested in the Lower Mainland-Southwest. A super basic plot to start with would be a scatter plot of $ amount vs. year with a trendline for each variable.

Way to put both expenses and sales in this plot?

```{r}
exp_rec_01_11 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, sales, colour = CAR)) +
  geom_point(aes()) +
  geom_line()
```


### 3.2 Plot 2 & Writing to file

For this second plot, I'd like to incorporate some more information using some different visualization tips. I don't have a whole lot to work with for this small dataframe, but I'd like to incorporate a measure for the difference between farm sales and expenses, as well as communicate the number of farms reporting in each of the regions. I'll also spiff up the colour scheme and labels, etc. 


```{r fig.width=10}
reg_profit <- exp_rec_01_11 %>% 
  mutate(prof = (sales - totexp)) %>% 
  filter(CAR %in% c("Lower Mainland-Southwest", "Thompson-Okanagan", "Vancouver Island-Coast", "Peace River", "Cariboo")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, prof, colour = CAR, size=nfarms)) +
  geom_line(size=1.5) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("Darjeeling")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2001,2006,2011)) +
  labs(x="Year", y="Regional Farm Sales - Expenses", title="Regional Difference Between Farm Sales and Expenses") +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(size=16, hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "right",
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.title = element_text(size=12)) 
```

```{r}
 ggsave("reg_profit.pdf", plot = reg_profit, width = 9, height = 7) # specicying the plot as the default is to save the last displayed plot (not necessarily the last code chunk)
  ggsave("reg_profit.png", plot = reg_profit, width = 9, height = 7) # saving as both png (raster) and pdf (vector) formats to working directory
```


![**Plot 2**. New and improved visual representation of my simple yet extremely labour-intensive new dataset for the sales and expenses on farms in Census Agricultural Regions in B.C.](/Users/susannaklassen/Documents/PhD/STAT 545/stat545-hw-klassen-susanna/hw05/reg_profit.png)

From this figure we can clearly see that the the Lower Mainland-Southwest stands out clearly as having higher sales relative to farm business operating expenses. This was also visible in my first plot, but with the new measure (encompassing values of sales and expenses) we can see a few new things: 
1. The Thompson-Okanagan region is much closer to values seen in other region (and therefore must have high operating expenses)
2. Lower Mainland-Southwest is the only region showing a clear increase in what I am calling 'Estimated Farm Profit'
3. One could assume that there are more farms in the region clearly showing high sales relative to expenses, but it is clear from this second plot that the Thompson-Okanagan region also has a high number of farms, but are clearly not as high net value at the regional level.
