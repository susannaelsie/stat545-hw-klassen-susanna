## Working with factors

- I had some issues using the forcats package command ```fct_drop()``` and didn't really have time to trouble shoot why (and I immediately tried the base package version and it worked, so I didn't look too much further!)
- I found <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s133/factors.html">this resource from Berkley</a> that gave a bit of background on why factors are useful in regression analyses for categorical variables (something I will be doing). I found this context to be helpful!
