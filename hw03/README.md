# Description of hw03

This assignment uses the ```Gapminder``` dataset using ```dplyr``` as the data manipulation tool, and ```ggplot2``` as the visualization tool. 

I enjoyed the idea of using this assignment as a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(needlework)">"sampler"</a> -- and held this concept in mind as I built my Rmarkdown file.


## Reflection on Process

I am starting to get the hang of this workflow (or at least, one that works for me!). Some notes:

* To accomplish this assignment more efficiently than the last, I had my ```ggplot2``` and markdown syntax cheat sheets open. 
* I created the hw03 file and associated readme.md file quickly and easily on my online github repo, then worked on adding to my readme.md file as well as my Rmarkdown assignment file on my local repo (committing, pulling, and pushing to the online repo periodically).
