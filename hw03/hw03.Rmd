## Outline

I will be accomplishing the following tasks in this assignment
1. Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.
2. How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?
3. Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.

### 1. Spread of GDP per capita within continents
