# Homework 1 by Susanna Klassen

Welcome one and all to my first homework assignment (hw01)! For more details on the course, and this and other assigments, see the course <a href=http://stat545.com>Website</a>.

## About me

I am a first year PhD Student at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. My research looks at how we can create more sustainable agri-food systems, specifically looking at the social and environmental performance of organic agriculture in the Canadian context. 

My research uses a mixed-methods approach (using both qualitative and quantitative data), following the words <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/">often attributed to Albert Einstein</a>:

> "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."
>
> William Bruce Cameron 

I'm excited to be learning how to wrangle data so that I can apply it to my project!

## Notes about process

As much as possible, I edited this README.md file using markdown in RStudio. For some minor and quick changes (e.g. adding a period at the end of a sentence), I sometimes used my browser (twice), but for all significant changes or edits (adding Markdown syntax of any kind), I made changes via my local repo in RStudio. 

In general, my general process followed this format:
1. Make a small number of changes/additions 
    - e.g. adding a new header and associated section with one new markdown feature such as a list)
2. Save these changes as I go along
3. Pull changes from Github (purely for good form)
4. Commit recently saved changes to my local repo
    - with a note to describe the change
5. Push the commit 'up' to Github repo
6. Refresh hw01 README.md file in Github using my browser to display changes
    - Many unexpected errors were viewed at this stage 
7. Repeat, allowing me to fix errors not seen in 'raw' markdown files

#### Exceptions
When basic troubleshooting using the raw markdown file for the homework example was insufficient, I used google to see if there were other helpful hints to be found on ther interweb. For example, I couldn't get my gif to load even though the very simple code seemed to match that on the raw sample readme.md file. Remembering that a TA had said in class to my neighbour that sometimes the solution is to erase and re-write the code, I erased what was written and copied in the code from <a href= "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jhsu/2550829/raw/0cb4f77d83e0783e89d361df0f8501ddb668d2fb/gifs.markdown">this website</a> (found using google). 

I also used <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-create-a-hyperlink-in-the-README-file-in-my-GitHub-account-which-would-redirect-to-a-new-page-containing-the-project-explanation">this post</a> on QUORA (also found via a google search) to walk me through some different ways of adding hyperlinks to my README.md file. 

#### Learning [how and when] to commit

I experienced one panicked instance when I realized that I had made edits to my github repo online as well as my local repo. I felt a wonderful sense of relief and enhanced understanding of the version control power of Github when I remembered that as long as the changes were not conflicting, my 'commit', 'pull' and 'push' steps as outlined above would be sufficient to merge all of my changes into one without losing valuable edits. 

After making several successful changes to my README.md file, I felt more confident commiting *less* frequently, while continuing to save to my local repo often. 

#### Another helpful resource

Similar to the sample readme.md file from STAT545, I found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/reference/markdown-guidance">this helpful resource</a> from Microsoft Visual Studio with many helpful syntax tips for Markdown. 

#### Using R Markdown

This was generally a straightforward process, as it allowed me to structure each step and narrate with comments in a way that is easy to visualize! I found the most confusing part to be understanding the Rmd vs the md files, but going through the steps helped me to figure this out.
