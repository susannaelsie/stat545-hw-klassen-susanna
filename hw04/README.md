# About Homework 4

For this assignment, I decided to leave my comfort zone and try working with some Canadian Agricultural Census data (relevant to my research). Because we are now working with data reshaping and aggregation, and have learned some pretty powerful `dplyr` functions to work with large datasets, I decided this was a good opportunity to do this.

## My Process

**Downloading the data**: I retrieved the data tables from the <a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a03?lang=eng&pattern=004-0200..004-0246&p2=31">Statistics Canada CANSIM website</a>. More details on the specific data to be 'wrangled' will be in the assignment.
