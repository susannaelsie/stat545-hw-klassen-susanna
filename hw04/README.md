# About Homework 4

For this assignment, I decided to leave my comfort zone and try working with some Canadian Agricultural Census data (relevant to my research). Because we are now working with data reshaping and aggregation, and have learned some pretty powerful `dplyr` functions to work with large datasets, I decided this was a good opportunity to do this.

## My Process

**Downloading the data**: I retrieved the data tables from the <a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a03?lang=eng&pattern=004-0200..004-0246&p2=31">Statistics Canada CANSIM website</a>. More details on the specific data to be 'wrangled' will be in the assignment. 

Data Table | Details
------------ | -------------
Fruits, Berries & Nuts | Table 004-0214 Census of Agriculture, area and number of farms growing fruits, berries and nuts
Gross Farm Receipts | Table 004-0233 Census of Agriculture, number of farms classified by total gross farm receipts 
Paid Non-Farm Work | Table 004-0242 Census of Agriculture, number of farm operators by paid non-farm work
Farm Operator Work On-Farm | Table 004-0241 Census of Agriculture, number of farm operators by average number of hours per week worked 
Total Farm Capital | Table 004-0232 Census of Agriculture, farms classified by total farm capital
