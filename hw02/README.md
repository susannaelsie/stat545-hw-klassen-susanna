# Creating new folders on Github

Even in setting up this second homework I have learned something new. One cannot create an empty folder on github the way one would on their computer folder/filing system. And there is no 'create new folder button' either! Instead, I went the 'create new file'route, and to create this file wihtin a folder one just needs to type a slash (/) following the folder name, and then create a file within that folder, and commit this.

#### Creating another README.md file

I'm not sure if I did this the most efficient or elegant way, but I did this via my online repo, by simply creating a new file called 'README.md' in the 'hw02' folder.
