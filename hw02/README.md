# Welcome to my hw02!

## Some notes before I begin the actual work

#### Creating new folders on Github

Even in setting up this second homework I have learned something new. One cannot create an empty folder on github the way one would on their computer folder/filing system. And there is no 'create new folder button' either! Instead, I went the 'create new file'route, and to create this file wihtin a folder one just needs to type a slash (/) following the folder name, and then create a file within that folder, and commit this.

#### Creating another README.md file

I'm not sure if I did this the most efficient or elegant way, but I did this via my online repo, by simply creating a new file called 'README.md' in the 'hw02' folder.

## Section 5 - Doing more

The Simply stats thread for section 5 was helpful generally, but also tipped me off to the fact that the code wasn't getting all of the values for each country. Specifically, this thread:

> After doing that I look for weird quirks, like if there are missing values or outliers like @feralparakeet

> @hmason ALL THE DESCRIPTIVES. Well, after reviewing the codebook, of course. — Vickie Edwards (@feralparakeet) June 12, 2014

> and like @cpwalker07

> @hmason count # rows, read every column header — Chris Walker (@cpwalker07) June 12, 2014

> and like @toastandcereal

> @hmason@mispagination jot down number of rows. That way I can assess right away whether I've done something dumb later on. — Jessica Balsam (@toastandcereal) June 12, 2014

I explored the ```knitr:kable``` tip, but was unable to install the kable package (assuming I had to). I did find this <a href="http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/pages/figs_tables.html">'knitr in a knutshell'</a> resource that would have been helpful had I more time.
