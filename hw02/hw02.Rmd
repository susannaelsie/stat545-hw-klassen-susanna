Fisrt, I'll call up the gapminder dataset and tidyverse package (meta-package that contains dplyr - what we are actually interested in).

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Smell testing the data

One of the first questions to ask when working with a new dataset would be, what kind of form/structure does this dataset have? To answer this question, we can use the 

```{r}
names(gapminder)
```
