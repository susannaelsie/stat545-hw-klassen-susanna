## About me

I am a first year PhD Student at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. My research looks at how we can create more sustainable agri-food systems, specifically looking at the social and environmental performance of organic agriculture in the Canadian context. 

My research uses a mixed-methods approach (using both qualitative and quantitative data), following the words <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/26/everything-counts-einstein/">often attributed to Albert Einstein</a>:

> "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."
>
> William Bruce Cameron 

I'm excited to be learning how to wrangle data so that I can apply it to my project!
